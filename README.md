# Agent-Based Governance Network Model

## Overview
This project implements a dynamic, agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate the evolution of a fragile governance network. The model formalizes qualitative findings about trust-building, institutional fragility, and actor motivation into a set of computational rules. Its purpose is to serve as a "thought experiment" to explore how micro-level interactions generate macro-level changes in network structure over time. The model is implemented in Python, leveraging the Mesa framework for agent scheduling and data collection, and the NetworkX library for network representation and analysis.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tumaco_model.git
    cd tumaco_model
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    (On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source venv/bin/activate`)

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running Simulations and Generating Plots
To run the simulations and generate all results (network visualizations, data CSVs, and time series plots), follow these steps:

1.  **Run the simulations:**
    This script executes all three predefined scenarios **multiple times (currently 100 runs per scenario)** to account for stochasticity. It saves the network visualizations (from the first run of each scenario) and raw data (aggregated across all runs) to the `results/` directory.
    ```bash
    python3 run_simulations.py
    ```

2.  **Generate time series plots:**
    This script loads the aggregated data generated by `run_simulations.py` and creates comparative time series plots for key metrics across all scenarios. **These plots show the average metric value at each step, with shaded areas representing the spread (e.g., standard deviation) across the multiple runs.** The plots will also be saved in the `results/` directory.
    ```bash
    python3 plot_results.py
    ```

## Simulation Scenarios and Questions

The model explores different hypotheses through three distinct simulation scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Facilitated Network Growth (Baseline)
*   **Setup:** The model runs with an `ACADEMIC` "Catalyst" agent actively triggering Forum Events at a regular frequency, facilitating interactions.
*   **Question:** How does consistent facilitation influence the growth and density of the governance network?
*   **Hypothesis:** The network's density and average clustering coefficient will increase over time. Bridging links will form, connecting initial clusters, leading to a more cohesive network.

### Scenario 2: Institutional Fragility and Key Actor Departure
*   **Setup:** The model runs as in Scenario 1, but at a specific midpoint (step 50), a high-commitment "Environmental Management Unit" (`GOVERNMENT`) agent is removed from the model.
*   **Question:** What is the impact of the sudden departure of a key, highly committed actor on the network's cohesion and project success?
*   **Hypothesis:** The network will experience a sharp drop in cohesion (e.g., increase in shortest path length, potential disconnection of components). The overall rate of successful "Joint Projects" will decrease, highlighting institutional fragility.

### Scenario 3: The Resource Opportunity Window
*   **Setup:** The model runs as in Scenario 1, but at a midpoint (step 50), a special "Resource Opportunity" node with effectively infinite resources is introduced into the graph. Agents can attempt to form links with this new node.
*   **Question:** How does the introduction of a significant, external resource opportunity affect resource distribution and network structure, particularly benefiting well-resourced and well-connected agents?
*   **Hypothesis:** Agents that are already well-resourced and well-connected will be the primary beneficiaries, capturing the opportunity and potentially increasing resource inequality within the system.

## Outputs
Upon running the simulation and plotting scripts, the `results/` directory will contain the following:

### Network Visualizations
*   `initial_network.png`: Visualization of the network at the start of Scenario 1 (from the first run).
*   `final_network.png`: Visualization of the network at the end of Scenario 1 (from the first run).
*   `scenario2_initial_network.png`: Visualization of the network at the start of Scenario 2 (from the first run).
*   `scenario2_final_network.png`: Visualization of the network at the end of Scenario 2 (from the first run).
*   `scenario3_initial_network.png`: Visualization of the network at the start of Scenario 3 (from the first run).
*   `scenario3_final_network.png`: Visualization of the network at the end of Scenario 3 (from the first run).

### Raw Data (Aggregated CSVs)
These CSV files contain data aggregated across all simulation runs, with a multi-index for 'Run' and 'Step'.
*   `scenario1_model_data_all_runs.csv`: Model-level data collected during Scenario 1.
*   `scenario1_agent_data_all_runs.csv`: Agent-level data collected during Scenario 1.
*   `scenario2_model_data_all_runs.csv`: Model-level data collected during Scenario 2.
*   `scenario2_agent_data_all_runs.csv`: Agent-level data collected during Scenario 2.
*   `scenario3_model_data_all_runs.csv`: Model-level data collected during Scenario 3.
*   `scenario3_agent_data_all_runs.csv`: Agent-level data collected during Scenario 3.

### Comparative Time Series Plots
These plots show the evolution of key network metrics over time for all three scenarios, allowing for direct comparison. Each line represents the average metric value across multiple runs, with shaded areas indicating the spread (e.g., standard deviation).
*   `Average_Clustering_time_series.png`: Compares the average clustering coefficient.
*   `Gini_Coefficient_time_series.png`: Compares the Gini coefficient of agent resources.
*   `Largest_Connected_Component_Size_time_series.png`: Compares the size of the largest connected component.
*   `Network_Density_time_series.png`: Compares the network density.
*   `Number_of_Active_Edges_time_series.png`: Compares the number of active edges.
*   `Resource_Node_Degree_time_series.png`: Compares the degree of the resource node (will be 0 for Scenarios 1 and 2 until the resource node is introduced).
*   `Successful_Projects_time_series.png`: Compares the number of successful projects per step.
